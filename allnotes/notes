what is backdend ?
Ans :-(1) Back-end is the server-side of an application, which is responsible for handling requests, storing data,and performing complex computations. It is the part of the application that users do not directly interact with.
(2) backend developer wo banda hai jo ki server and db program karta hai 

why backend?
Ans :-(1) Because it is the part of the application that users do not directly interact with application 
(2) to make website more usable and purposefult for the audience, to make website dynamic 

why not frontend alone ? 
with frontend websites are static and they are of not much use 
frontend is only for user interface and user experience, backend is for data and functionality of the website.

what do we need ?
nodejs, mongodb, mongoosejs, expressjs
